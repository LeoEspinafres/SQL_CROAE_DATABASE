For school we were asked to create a database on anything we would like to. This idea truly fell from the sky when speaking with the responsible for the animal shelter I volunteer for said that
they had an intern doing a database for them. I was curious and asked what sort of work was he doing, and they said that the guy was copying everything from the 150+ PDF's they had into
an excel spreadsheet. So, that's the whole idea for this project.
